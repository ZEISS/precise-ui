**Elementary**

We can use the (default) auto placement to just show a simple tooltip on its ideal position. The component supports two modes - managed and controlled. By default, the managed mode is selected.

```jsx
import { Tooltip, Avatar } from 'precise-ui';

<Tooltip content="Tooltip content">
  <Avatar initials="R" description="Sample" size="x-small" />
</Tooltip>
```

The tooltip needs to wrap the content for which it needs to present some content. This pattern ensures the autoplacement and managed mode (on hover) is applied correctly.
