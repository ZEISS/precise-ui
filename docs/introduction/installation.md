### Installation

Precise UI can be easily integrated in your frontend project by using npm or Yarn. To start using it, please follow the instructions below:

1. Firstly, you have to install it:

  ```bash
  npm i precise-ui
  ```

  or alternatively, using Yarn

  ```bash
  yarn add precise-ui
  ```

2. Then, make sure that you have also all peer dependencies installed:

  ```

3. If you want to use TypeScript there is nothing to do here. All the typings are already included!
