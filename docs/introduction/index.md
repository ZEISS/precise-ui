## Getting Started

### Precise UI React Component Library

Precise UI gives you a UI component library fully based on **React**. This means that everything, not only the components, but also the styling and assets are fully provided as JavaScript modules. These modules use the React library for rendering.

### Features

- There are more than **75** components currently available in this library and even more are being implemented. Make sure you check the [Components](#/Components/Accordion) section for a better overview.
- It is written in **TypeScript**.
- You can build fully responsive applications with it.

### Browser Support

It fully supports **IE9+, Chrome, Firefox and Safari**.

**Important** IE (and older versions of some browsers) support still requires some polyfills. Furthermore, the resulting bundle should be ES5 compatible.
